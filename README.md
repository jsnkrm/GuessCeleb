# GuessCeleb
An android application that pulls html content from a website and lets the user engage in a celebrity guessing game.
It uses Async Task (which I got to learn doing this project), which lets asynchronous activities such as downloading content
from the internet to be done on a separate thread rather tha the UI thread itself, hence making the app load UI components without any lag.
